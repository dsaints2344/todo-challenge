## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - UI library
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - React management library
- Typescript

### What I learned

I learned how to use the zustand library (state management), implemented it in the challenge solution as a way to avoid prop drilling without too much boilerplate (given my experience with another state manager library, like redux). Also, I learned how to implement some level of responsive design using Chakra UI's utility components. And also with the same UI library, I learned how to toogle between light and dark mode.

### Continued development

I would like to learn more in-depth responsive design practices, specially, the transitions between components for different devices dimensions (mobile to desktop).
